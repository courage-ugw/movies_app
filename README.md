# Mini Movie App

## Description
A movie application that stores movie names and their ratings and communicates 
with users via command line.

The application supports two different commands:

### 1. CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete
* add movies (Create), 
* view the existing movies (Read), 
* update movies (Update), and 
* delete movies (Delete)
* search movie

### 2. Analytics
  * the top-rated movie, 
  * the least-rated movie
  * movies sorted by rating

### 3. Multiple Storage Files
* For instance, assuming members of a family use the application, e.g., John, Sara, and 
  Jack. 

* Each family member has their favorite movies that they want to store in the movie 
  app. The application serves all the family members such that each family member has 
  their own storage file while they store their personal movie. 
  * For example, you may have:
    * 
        john.json - John's storage file
    * 
        sara.json - Sara's storage file
    * 
        jack.csv - Jack's storage file
